    <h1>PHP Loops</h1>
    <h2>While loops</h2>
    <ul><li>A while loop is the simplest of loops, the loop keeps iterating while condition evauates to true</li>
    <li>Do while is a similar, but slightly different in how the first iteration is performed</li>
    <li>In the do while loop, first we do the first iteration and then we check the condition</li>
    <li>You can use a for loop easily to iterate over an array</li>
    <li>The for loop is similar to while, but instead of defining the variable used in the conditional before the loop and instead of incrementing the index variable manually its all in the first line</li>
    </ul>
