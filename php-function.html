    <h1>PHP Functions</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>A function is composed of an identifier followed by parentheses</li>
        <li>Inside those parentheses we pass one of more arguments to the function</li>
        <li>The function does something and when its done it can return a value</li>
        <li>If there is no value returned the function returns a null</li>
        <li>Functionss are one of the most important concepts in programming</li>
        <li>You can use functions to group together multiple instructions or multiple lines of code and give them a name</li>
        <li>You can call a function anywhere </li>
        <li>You can also pass arguments to a function, these arguments are called parameters inside the function definition and we call them arguments when we call them in the function</li>
        <li>You can set the type of parameters of a function</li>
        <li>You can also set a default value for the parameters</li>
        <li>A function can return a value</li>
        <li>Only one value can be returned from a function, not more than one</li>
        <li>You do this by using the return keyword</li>
        <li>If the return word is omitted the function returns null</li>
        <li>The returned value is useful as it tell you the result of the work done in the function, and lets you use its results after calling it</li>
        <li>You can optionally set the return type of a functuon</li>
        <li>When you define a varuable inside a function, that variable is local to that function.  Meaning its not visible from the outside.  When the function ends it just stops existing</li>
        <li>Varaiable defined outside of the function are not accessible inside the function, this enforces good programming practice, as we can be sure that the function does not modify excternal variables and cause "side effects"</li>
    </ul>
